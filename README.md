# BeamNG Cops and Robbers
Iskelmaikel's BeamNG Cops and Robbers is a carhunt-like multiplayer gamemode that puts players in the shoes of escaping criminals and chasing cops. Robbers need to escape the police by finding their own way through randomly placed waypoints while the cops try to stop them in thrilling car chases. Both cops and robbers need to use their cunning to reach their goals 

# note: project still in development and is not yet fully functional

## Planned features
- Team based carhunt-like gameplay
- Randomly placed waypoints for robbers
- Various preconfigured car setups for both teams (light, medium, heavy) classes
  - Light but quick setup
  - Medium all-rounder
  - Slow but heavy-hitter
  - Configurable by server
- Simple and clean UI
- Dynamic punishment/assistance system for arrested robbers
  - Some ideas:
  - Robbers become vigilante  (slower assisting police)
  - Short timeout (jailtime). Afterwards the robber 'escapes' and can continue
  - Arrested robbers can hackle cops with slow
